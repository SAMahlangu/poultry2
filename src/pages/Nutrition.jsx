                    <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Essential for muscle growth, feather development, and egg production. Ensure the feed contains about 16-20% protein, especially for laying hens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Provide energy for daily activities. Corn and grains are excellent sources, but a balanced feed is necessary to prevent obesity and maintain energy levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Important for nutrient absorption and energy storage. Include healthy fats like sunflower seeds or flaxseeds to promote glossy feathers and overall health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitamins and Minerals:</strong> Crucial for various bodily functions, including tissue formation, enzyme activity, and blood cell production. Minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, sodium, magnesium, and potassium are vital for forming eggshells and bones. Essentially, vitamins are categorized into two respective groups: fat-soluble and water-soluble.</li>

                <p>Now that one has a basic understanding of what crucial nutrition is and how they affect the breeding of the birdsâ€™ anatomy and physiological aspect, we will look at the nutritional value of each nutrient and its composition to the needs and requirements of the birds.</p>
